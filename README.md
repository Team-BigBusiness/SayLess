# SayLess

# About
SayLess is a fun "phrased-based" game where your opponent attempts to guess the entire phrase correctly with only half of the characters used in the original phrase.

# Demo
Player One and Player Two enter the game. Player One can create their own phrase to use or choose a phrase from the phrase bank on the site. Player One is then tasked with shortening their chosen phrase using half the characters used in the original phrase. The shortened phrase is then displayed to Player Two. Player Two must guess the phrase correctly in order to win the game! If Player Two wins, then they will be rewarded with points equivalent to the number of characters in the original phrase.
